# Advanced Data Pipeline for NLP and Text Analysis

## Overview

This project is an advanced data pipeline designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analysis tasks. It provides a robust, scalable, and flexible framework for processing, analyzing, and deriving insights from large volumes of textual data.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and customize for specific use cases.
- **Multi-format Support**: Process text, PDFs, images (OCR), and audio (speech-to-text).
- **Advanced NLP Capabilities**:
  - Text Embedding
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Named Entity Recognition
  - Topic Modeling
  - Text Summarization
  - Question Answering
  - And more...
- **Time Series Analysis**: Detect trends, anomalies, and change points in temporal data.
- **Scalability**: Parallel processing and distributed caching for high-performance.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Track pipeline performance and receive notifications.
- **Model Versioning**: Manage and version machine learning models effectively.
